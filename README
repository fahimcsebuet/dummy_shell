- Directory Structure
1. MyShell - Main directory that holds all the files for the shell implementation. It has the following items-
1.1. command.cpp
1.2. command.h
1.3. myshell.cpp
1.4. utility.cpp
1.5. command_executor.cpp
1.6. Makefile
1.7. utility.h
1.8. command_executor.h
1.9. output - The output file "myshell" is generated in this directory
1.10. Myls - Directory that holds the file for myls implementation
1.10.1. myls.cpp
1.11.2. output - The output file "myls" is generated in this directory
1.11. README

- Makefile
1. The output directories in MyShell and Myls should be created beforehand in order to be run successfully
2. "make clean" command to clean the outputs
3. "make" command to build myshell and myls

- Supported Commands:
1. Built-in Commands:
1.1. exit - Exits from myshell and goes to the linux shell. CTRL+D is also handled. It also exits from myshell to the linux shell
1.2. cd - Changes Directory. Performs exactly as the linux shell.
     - cd [DIRECTORY]
     - if no DIRECTORY, changes directory to user's HOME. Also supports '~' sign to change directory to HOME. Supports absolute path starting with '/'
1.3. pwd - Prints the absolute path of the Current Directory
1.4. set - Sets an Environment Variable in the local Environment of myshell
     - set [ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE NAME]=[ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE VALUE]
     - Important: There should not be any SPACE character between "=" and [ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE NAME] or "=" and [ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE VALUE]
2. Self-built External Command
2.1. myls - Replicates the output of ls -l
     - myls [DIRECTORY or FILE(Optional)]
     - Shows the number of total 1M blocks in the folder
     - Displays the access levels of different users led by the type of the item (d for directory, l for link and - for regular file)
     - Shows total number of items in the directory
     - Shows the user name
     - Displays the host name
     - Shows file size
     - Shows last update date and time
     - Shows the file or directory name
     - Also shows the absolute path of the file or directory after '->' if it is a link
     - Points: myls shows the files or folder in alphabetic order and total block number is printed after the list (In linux shell it is printed before the list)
     - Important: run "set MYPATH=/path/to/myls" in myshell to make myls work from myshell
3. External Commands - All the External Commands in the paths of "PATH" Environment Variable. myshell traverses through the "PATH" variable entries to search for any command. If found the command is executed properly

- Features
1. Running Single Command - It can run single command with or without parameter
2. Running Multiple Piped Commands - It can run arbitrary number of piped commands. The piped commands are handled in a loop, so please feel free to pipe any number of commands. Space is not an issue in piped commands, there can be or can not be SPACE character by the side of "|". i.e. "command1|command2" or "command1| command2" or "command1 | command2" all are alright
3. Background Execution - myshell allows background execution. Please put "&" to check the background execution. Sometimes, the prefix of the command (i.e. '[prefix_info]$') can be printed before the background command prints output. This can be a bit confusing, but foreground can function properly while the background is still working. Try "sleep 5&" and "cd" or any other command
4. I/O Redirection - The commands in myshell can take input from a file (e.g. command<file.txt) or write to a file the outputs of a command (e.g. command> file.txt). Space is not an issue also in file redirection
